# OptimazeClient

Optimaze is my gradutation project, it is very similar to a 3D tetris.

## Objective of the project

You want to destroy the blocks you see when you start to the game, by releasing the pending cubes which float.

Red blocks destroy the blue blocks and vice-versa.

Your main objective in the game is achieving maximum number of green field.

## How to run

For running the project you must extract the web.rar and Library.rar files inside this folder.

For playing the game locally you must also download server side part of the project which can be found from this link https://github.com/koraybolat/OptimazeServer


## How to play

When you start the server side and client side of the project, you will see a scene like this.

You can rotate the view by pressing "A" (for left), "D" (for right), "W" (for upward) and "S" (for downward).

You can click the screen by pressing left click of your mouse for changing the floating cubes.  

You can release the floating cubes by pressing "space" button of your keyboard. (IMPORTANT: You cannot release the floating cubes if there is a white cube)
